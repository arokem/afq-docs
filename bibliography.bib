              researchers with unprecedented capabilities for detecting and
              characterizing pathologic processes in the developing human
              brain. As a result, ambitions to achieve clinically useful tools
              to assist in the diagnosis and management of mental health and
              learning disorders are gaining momentum. To this end, it is
              critical to accrue large-scale multimodal datasets that capture a
              broad range of commonly encountered clinical psychopathology. The
              Child Mind Institute has launched the Healthy Brain Network
              (HBN), an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a
              biobank of data from 10,000 New York area participants (ages
              5-21). The HBN Biobank houses data about psychiatric, behavioral,
              cognitive, and lifestyle phenotypes, as well as multimodal brain
              imaging (resting and naturalistic viewing fMRI, diffusion MRI,
              morphometric MRI), electroencephalography, eye-tracking, voice
              and video recordings, genetics and actigraphy. Here, we present
              the rationale, design and implementation of HBN protocols. We
              describe the first data release (n=664) and the potential of the
              biobank to advance related areas (e.g., biophysical modeling,
              voice analysis).",
