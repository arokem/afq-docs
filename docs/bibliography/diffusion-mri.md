# Resources for learning the basics of diffusion MRI

## Here as some basic readings to introduuce the field

Wandell BA (2016) Clarifying Human White Matter. Annu Rev Neurosci 39(1):annurev-neuro-070815-013815.

## Automated Fiber Quantification is a method for analyzing white matter tracts

Here is the paper that introducued the method:
Yeatman JD, Dougherty RF, Myall NJ, Wandell BA, Feldman HMM (2012) Tract profiles of white matter properties: automating fiber-tract quantification. PLoS One 7(11):e49790.

And here is a more recent paper introducing a browser-based visualization and analysis tool to support reproducibility and data sharing

Yeatman JD, Richie-Halford A, Smith JKJK, Keshavan A, Rokem A (2018) A browser-based tool for visualization and analysis of diffusion MRI data. Nat Commun 9(1):940.

## Blogs and tutorials

The OHBM has a blog with videos based on the educational course given at the
annual meeting [here](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-ondemand-how-to-diffusion-mri).

Here is a tutorial walking through the basics of diffusion MRI

# Software tutorials to learn how to analyze diffusion MRI data

The original matlab version of AFQ comes with tutorials and example data. 
1) Clone the AFQ repo (and dependencies) here: https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ
2) Read the brief wiki page: https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/wiki
3) In a MATLAB terminal type help AFQ_run and then run the example here to process the example dataset
4) See the AFQ_example totorial as well https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/blob/master/tutorials/AFQ_example.m
5) See the Group Comparison example https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/blob/master/tutorials/AFQ_example_GroupComparison.m
