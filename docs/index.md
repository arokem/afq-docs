# DIRECT : Data-intensive REsearch in ConnecTomics

Human neuroscience is rapidly turning towards data-driven research thanks in
large part to concerted efforts that collect and aggregate large
[openly-available datasets](background/datasets.md).

DIRECT is a collaboration focused on data-driven understanding of the human
connectome. We develop and use tools that quantify different aspects of human brain
networks and relate brain network properties to complex behavioral phenotypes.
Our work bridges between human neuroscience and statistical learning.

We focus our investigations primarily on the measurements of the white matter
contains the long-range connections between different brain regions. Diffusion
MRI (dMRI) is a powerful imaging technology that provides non-invasive *in vivo*
measurements of these connections. These measurements have provided compelling
evidence that the biophysical properties of these connections account for
individual variation in many important cognitive skills, and they predict
clinical symptoms across a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders
(reviewed in [@Rokem2017JoVWM] and [@wandell2016clarifying]). Want to learn

To make our work widely applicable, we develop an ecosystem of open-source
software [projects](about/projects.md).

See the [team](about/team.md).

We are grateful for [funding](about/funding.md) that supports our work.

## TODO: Expectations for autofq site?
Is autofq the central information repository or is it an overview and visitors should go to individual project websites/github pages?

## TODO: What is AFQ?
Could leverage some content from [AFQ wiki](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/wiki)

## TODO: Who is AFQ?
Background information on project(s)? Who to contact for questions? Citations for usage?

## TODO: Why is AFQ?
More on motivation. Define intended audiences (e.g., researchers/library users and developers)
-->

<!--
## TODO: What are some intended uses and use cases?
* Incorporate links to samples/examples/tutorials.
* What knowledge is assumed? (e.g., neuroanatomy, neuroinformatics, neuro imaging, tractometry, git, python, AWS).
* Do want to get into providing background resources (e.g., review papers, dictionary terminology)
* Create use case documentation (how to install and run [local vs cloud] vs how to set up development environment and contribute)
-->

<!--
## TODO: Based on my use case, how do I know which project to use? How do the projects relate/integrate? What are they capable of what are limitations? release schedule information?
## TODO: What is processing pipeline? diagram? what are steps? which are optional? what are tolerances (recommended settings for use cases)?
## TODO: requirements? assumptions? dependencies? integration? interoperability? standards/specifications?
## TODO: How to diagnose or debug output? tests? confirm validity? sanity checks?
