# Installing Python packages

The best way to use Python and not go crazy is to use a virtual environment
manager. These programs make sure that computational environments are kept
isolated from each other and internally consistent.

## Conda

This one is (slightly) preferred, because this is the environment manager we
use in our [Jupyterhub](jupyterhub.md)

## virtualenvwrapper

If you are going to use `virtualenv` you may as well use [`virtualenvwrapper`](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
