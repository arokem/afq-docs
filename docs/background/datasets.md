# Data sets for human connectomics

## Human Connectome Project

The [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) provides
high-quality MRI data from more than 1,200 young healthy individuals, coupled
with behavioral and genetic information [@].


## Healthy Brain Network (HBN)


The [HBN data](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/) is an incredible resource containing thousands of subjects with diffusion MRI, behavioral measures and clinical assessments and a great data useage agreement.

## UK Biobank
A paragon of this kind of data collection is the NIH-funded
Several other ongoing studies are currently
amassing datasets with many thousands of individuals: [The Healthy Brain Network
study](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/index.html) [@Alexander2017hbn] and [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development](https://abcdstudy.org/) study [@Jernigan2018abcd] will each collect
cross-sectional and longitudinal data from approximately 10,000 children during
their development, together with detailed information about their cognitive and
mental health development. The [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) will
eventually provide access to MRI measurements from approximately 100,000 individuals [@Sudlow2015ukbb].
Many other projects are also collecting very large datasets on a variety of clinical populations.
This trend is not likely to abate, as the field is becoming increasingly aware
that large samples are crucial for reproducibility and for accurate inferences
about the role of brain structure and function in complex behaviors and in
mental and neurological health [@marek2020repro]. In fact, these datasets are already having a
profound impact on neuroscience as data-driven methods are employed to
illuminate the biological underpinnings of human brain health in new and
important ways.
